### Developer Guide

1. Download [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
    * This will be used to read responses that our program will generate
2. Clone Repo onto your machine [How To Clone a Git Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
3. Read through the [Spring QuickStart Guide](https://spring.io/quickstart)

From the mirror project navigate to: mirror>src>main>java>edu.mc3.cis.group.mirror
   * This package is where we will be putting all of our work
   
   There are four packages within this package:
   * configs
   * controllers
   * models
   * services
   
I have written an example for you to follow that will serve as a guide:


1. Run the application and open PostMan
2. Go to your workspace and enter for the URL in your workspace: http://localhost:8080/news/hello
